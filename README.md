# Module-4

This application allows the user to login and view a catalogue of phones. The user will be able to select a phone and a map will appear which will show stores that have the selected phone in-stock for the user to purchase.

(Please note that the map will not appear in the apk due to a google api key being required, however it should work just fine in an android emulator)
